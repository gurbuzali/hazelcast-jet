    /**
     * Initiates the building of a streaming source which consumes a
     * Kinesis data stream and emits {@code Map.Entry<String, byte[]>}
     * items.
     * <p>
     * Each emitted item represents a Kinesis <em>record</em>, the basic
     * unit of data stored in KDS. A record is composed of a sequence
     * number, partition key, and data blob. This source ignores the
     * sequence numbers.
     * <p>
     * The <em>partition key</em> is used to segregate and route records
     * in Kinesis and is specified by the data producer, while adding
     * data to KDS. The keys of the returned items are the record
     * partition keys, unicode strings with a maximum length of 256
     * characters.
     * <p>
     * The <em>data blob</em> of the record is returned as the values of
     * the {@code Map.Entry} items, in the form of {@code byte} arrays.
     * The maximum size of the data blob is 1 MB.
     * <p>
     * The source is <em>distributed</em>, each instance is consuming
     * data from zero, one or more Kinesis shards, the base throughput
     * units of KDS. One shard provides a capacity of 2MB/sec data
     * output. Items with the same partition key always come from the
     * same shard, one shard contains multiple partition keys. Items
     * coming from the same shard are ordered and the source preserves
     * this order (except on resharding). The local parallelism of the
     * source is not defined, so will depend on the number of cores
     * available.
     * <p>
     * If snapshotting is enabled shard offsets are saved to the
     * snapsh√üot. After a restart, the source emits the events starting
     * from the same offset. The source supports both
     * <em>at-least-once</em> and <em>exactly-once</em> processing
     * guarantees.
     * <p>
     * The source is able to provide native timestams, in the sense that
     * they are read from KDS, but be aware that they are actually
     * Kinesis ingestion times, not event times in the strictest sense.
     * <p>
     * As stated before the source preserves the ordering inside shards.
     * However, Kinesis supports resharding, which lets you adjust the
     * number of shards in your stream to adapt to changes in data flow
     * rate through the stream. When resharding happens the source is
     * not able to preserve the order among the last items of a shard
     * being destroyed and the first items of new shards being created.
     *
